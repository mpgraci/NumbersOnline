## How to Play:
Numbers is a puzzle game that tests your ability to quickly manipulate a given set of numbers to reach a target number. This app gives you the tools to play in a classroom or with a group of friends. Think of it as a gameboard. Designed for smartboard and projector displays, you are giving plenty of space to write "on" the window for demostration purposes.

To play, you will select how many large numbers you want by using the dropdown box on the bottom of the window and hitting Set. Once done, the app will randomly select that many large numbers from a set, and fill the rest of the spots with randomly selected small numbers from another set. Once you have those numbers written down and everyone is ready with their own paper and pencil, hit Play. This wil randomly generate a 3 digit number as the target, and start the timer (standard time is 30 seconds, but this can be adjusted as you wish). The goal is to get as close to the target number as possible using only the 6 numbers provided. You can only use basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) and can only use each number once. You can not have a negative number or fraction at any part in your solution. You can not concatenate (you can't use "2" and "2" to make "22"). You do not have to use all of the numbers. The person closest to the target number wins the round. Scoring values can be found on the Rules popup.
